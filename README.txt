Presenting the slides
=====================

If external markdown files are used (recommended for large presentations) the slides have
to be presented from a HTTP server. Two very easy solutions are:
- cd slides ; python -m SimpleHTTPServer OR
- cd slided ; npm install http-server ; ./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
